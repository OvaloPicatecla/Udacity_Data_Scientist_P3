# Starbucks Capstone Project:
Repository for the final Udacity Data Scientist NanoDegree Project.

# Project Outline:

This dataset comprises simulated data emulating customer interactions within the Starbucks Rewards mobile app. Periodically, Starbucks dispatches offers to mobile app users, which can range from promotional advertisements for beverages to tangible offers like discounts or BOGO (buy one get one free) deals. Certain users may not receive any offers in specific weeks. The diversity of offers distributed among users presented a challenge addressed in this dataset. 
The objective is to integrate transaction, demographic, and offer information to discern which demographic segments exhibit optimal responses to specific offer types.
It's important to note that this dataset represents a simplified rendition of the actual Starbucks app, as the underlying simulator features only one product, while Starbucks, in reality, offers a wide array of products.
